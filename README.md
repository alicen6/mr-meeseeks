# Mr.Meeseeks Box

This project was created because a friend invited me to a Halloween party five days before the party. It is a collection of files that can be used to construct a Mr.Meeseeks Box, which is from the tv show "Rick and Morty".

## Materials

This is designed to be created with 1/8" material, what I used was birch plywood to create my box. It could be made out of several materials, including acrylic and plywood to make some sections clear, or glow with LEDs.

Some minor sanding may be required if you build the box the same way I did, otherwise it should fit together without issue.

## Process

After cutting all the pieces on the laser, or other machine, it should be fairly obvious which ones go where. Build the main body of the box first, saving the lid pieces for last. If you do this, you can use the main box to align the lid properly.

Depending on the button you find to use with the box, you may have to drill a hole for the button to sit right.

If I had more time, I would have added magnets to hold the lid in place. These can still be added by drilling small holes to hold the magnets inside the lid and gluing them in place.

Once the box is assembled, some of the part lines and edges will still be visible. I used bondo to fill the cracks and seams so that they weren't visible. Spot putty could also work to cover the seams.

After you've sealed (or not sealed) all your seams, you can paint. I used Montana paints in three colors that I felt most  closely matched the colors seen in the show. I started with the lightest color and worked my way to the darkest color, masking off sections as I went.
